# Online Dispute Resolution Protocol

## Introduction

**Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)** is a mechanism to resolve disputes through the use of electronic communication technology. It often uses alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools such as mediation, arbitration and negotiation. This mechanism not only provides citizens access to efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanisms, it also supports the formal court system by reducing the number of disputes that go to court, in turn helping address pendency in courts.

ODR is a wide field. The application of ODR is not limited to disputes arising out of business to consumer (B2C) online transactions, although it seems to be particularly apt for these disputes, since it is logical to use the same medium (the internet) for the resolution of e-commerce disputes when parties are frequently located far from one another. It is believed that efficient mechanisms to resolve online disputes will impact in the development of e-commerce. However, it may be applied to a range of disputes; from interpersonal disputes including consumer to consumer disputes (C2C) or marital separation; to court disputes and even interstate conflicts.  

The **Dispute Resolution Protocol Specification** (a.k.a DROP) is an adaptation of [beckn protocol](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-specifications) that aims to unify various online dispute resolution services through an interoperable API specification.
