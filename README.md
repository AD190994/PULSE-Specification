# Online Dispute Resolution Protocol

## Introduction

Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) is a mechanism to resolve disputes through the use of electronic communication technology. It often uses alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools such as mediation, arbitration and negotiation. This mechanism not only provides citizens access to efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanisms, it also supports the formal court system by reducing the number of disputes that go to court, in turn helping address pendency in courts.
Over the last 4 years, weâ€™ve seen an increase in ODR institutions from 3-5 to 12+ and over 100 enterprises have adopted ODR. Over eleven Indian states have conducted their Lok Adalats using ODR platforms amounting to a total of over 4 crore disputes onboarded; and institutions and digital ecosystems are also adopting ODR. NITI Aayog also formulated a national policy for ODR in 2020 - Designing the Future of Dispute Resolution: The ODR Policy Plan of India.

Several ODR institutions are advancing the dispute resolution experience for parties involved by bringing it online, offering a fast, cost-effective way to resolve disputes, and reducing the burden on courts.
