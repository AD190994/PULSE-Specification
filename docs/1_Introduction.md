### Online Dispute Resolution Sector

Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) is a mechanism to resolve disputes through the use of electronic communication technology. It often uses alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tools such as mediation, arbitration and negotiation. This mechanism not only provides citizens access to efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanisms, it also supports the formal court system by reducing the number of disputes that go to court, in turn helping address pendency in courts.
Over the last 4 years, we’ve seen an increase in ODR institutions from 3-5 to 12+ and over 100 enterprises have adopted ODR. Over eleven Indian states have conducted their Lok Adalats using ODR platforms amounting to a total of over 4 crore disputes onboarded; and institutions and digital ecosystems are also adopting ODR. NITI Aayog also formulated a national policy for ODR in 2020 - Designing the Future of Dispute Resolution: The ODR Policy Plan of India.

Several ODR institutions are advancing the dispute resolution experience for parties involved by bringing it online, offering a fast, cost-effective way to resolve disputes, and reducing the burden on courts.

### Opportunities for ODR

Recognizing the growth of ODR, multiple ecosystems and institutions are looking to integrate with multiple ODR service providers. Each of these ecosystems are required to connect with each ODR service provider separately & each ODR service provider is required to connect with the institutions separately. Moreover, consumers/parties to a dispute aren’t familiar with ODR/ODR opportunities they have. Some of the challenges & opportunities are listed below:

**Discovery of ODR service providers**: While institutions and ecosystems adoption of ODR is growing exponentially, end individuals aren’t familiar with ODR. Providing individuals options for dispute resolution through these institutions & making ODR discoverable is critical.

**Enable Integration**: Institutions seeking to adopt ODR & ODR service providers encounter difficulties when trying to integrate without a unified language or a common language to interact with each other.

**Expanded Opportunity**: With institutions and ecosystems adopting multiple ODR service providers, this allows ODR service providers to reach more individuals and opportunities.

**Technical and Data consistency**: Institutions and ODR service providers can speak the language while communicating and exchanging necessary data and status, while also accounting for data privacy.

The ODR community has come together to design a unified ODR Protocol and to unlock the full potential of ODR. The Unified ODR protocol is an open-source protocol based on Beckn APIs that establishes a common language enabling ecosystems/institutions seeking dispute resolution to easily discover and engage with multiple ODR service providers.

By virtue of a minimum viable standardized process/steps of communication, it eases the burden of multiple one-to-one integrations of ODR with ecosystems/institutions and also enables continuous sharing of status and updates to the respective ecosystem/institution as mutually decided.

This protocol will have multifold benefits across the spectrum of stakeholders. End-users will benefit from easy discovery and access to alternate dispute resolution mechanisms, end-to-end tracking, and increased visibility. ODR service providers will see an increased adoption of ODR as a method for dispute resolution. They will also be able to work with multiple ecosystems and platforms using the Unified ODR protocol. Instead of managing multiple unique integrations, they can focus more on building their value-added services and meeting ecosystem standards, rather than on navigating unique integrations. Additionally, this process will also supplement the efforts by the court system to streamline dispute resolution process and improve the dispute resolution experience.
